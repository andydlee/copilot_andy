# Quick example of generating a private github copilot like LLM as suggested by Chat GPT.



Configuring and training a language model like GitHub's Copilot or OpenAI's Codex requires several steps, including data preparation, model selection, fine-tuning, and deployment. 

However, training such models on private code hosted behind a firewall with no access to public sites can be challenging, as it requires special configurations and access to certain resources. Here are some general steps to help you get started:

1. Prepare the data: The first step is to prepare the data that you will use to train the language model. In this case, you will need to extract relevant code samples from your private code repository and clean them up for training. Depending on the size and complexity of your codebase, you may need to sample a subset of your code to train the model efficiently.

2. Set up the infrastructure: Next, you will need to set up the infrastructure to train and host the model. This will include a machine with sufficient computing power and memory to train the model, as well as any necessary software dependencies and configurations.

3. Select a model: Once you have your data and infrastructure set up, you will need to select a language model that is compatible with your private code. This may require some experimentation to find the best fit for your needs.

4. Fine-tune the model: With your model selected, you will need to fine-tune it on your private code. This involves training the model on your data and adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize its performance.

5. Test and validate: After fine-tuning the model, you will need to test and validate its performance on your private code. This may involve running a series of tests and comparing the results to manual code review or other benchmarks.

6. Deploy and use: Finally, you can deploy the model and use it to generate code suggestions or other relevant outputs in your code editor or other software tools.

Overall, training a language model like Copilot or Codex on private code requires careful planning and execution, but can ultimately help streamline and improve your software development process.

Sure! The layout and content of your train/test data will depend on your specific use case and goals. However, in general, you will want to include a set of code snippets or functions and associated metadata, such as the function name, language, and any relevant tags or labels. Here is an example CSV file format that you might use:


In this example, the train/test CSV files includes four columns:

1. `function_name`: The name of the function or code snippet.
2. `language`: The programming language used for the code snippet (e.g., Python, Java, C++, etc.).
3. `code_snippet`: The code snippet or function definition.
4. `tags`: Optional tags or labels that provide additional information about the code snippet (e.g., math, algorithms, sorting, searching, etc.).

You would typically have separate CSV files for your train and test sets, with a similar format for each. The train set would be used to fine-tune the language model, while the test set would be used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen code snippets.
